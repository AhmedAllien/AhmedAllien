## Introduction

Hi there! My name is Ahmad Ali Rashwaan and I am a software engineer with a passion for problem-solving and learning new technologies.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, Computer and Systems Section from Ain Shams University and have worked as a software engineer at Master Micro. I am skilled in languages such as C, C++, Python, and Java, as well as frameworks such as Qt and tools such as Git and Github.

I have completed coursework in data science, artificial intelligence, and image processing, and have completed projects in areas such as digital design, automation, and data analysis.

I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a software engineer, and I am excited to share my work and collaborate with others on Github. Thank you for visiting my profile!
