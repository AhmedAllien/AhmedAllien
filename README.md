## Introduction

Hi there! My name is Ahmad Ali Rashwaan and I am a software engineer with a passion for problem-solving and learning new technologies.

As a highly motivated and well-educated software engineer with a strong foundation in electrical engineering and computer systems, I am eager to find a position where I can continue to grow and learn. My experience at Master Micro Company has allowed me to develop my problem-solving skills and work effectively in a team environment.

I have a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, Computer and Systems Section from Ain Shams University and am proficient in a range of programming languages and frameworks, including C++, Java, and Python. I am also familiar with software development best practices, including agile methodologies and version control.

I am seeking a technically challenging and rewarding software engineering role where I can use my skills and dedication to make a positive impact. Thank you for considering my profile.

I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a software engineer, and I am excited to share my work and collaborate with others on Github. Thank you for visiting my profile!
